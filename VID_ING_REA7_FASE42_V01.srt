00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:17,679
EXPRESSING OPINIONS
As you know, news tells you facts.

2
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:24,260
Actual events that happened, are happening
or will happen.

3
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,859
There should be nothing ambiguous about the
news because they tell things as they are.

4
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:34,859
Let’s take a look at this headline.

5
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,910
Rigoletta Monteverdi elected as new president.

6
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,430
That is what happened.

7
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,899
It is told as a fact.

8
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,330
OPINIONS
People may also express their opinion and

9
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:51,789
ideas rather than pure facts.

10
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:57,989
Take a look at these opinions:
I believe Rigoletta Monteverdi will be a wonderful

11
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,289
president
I don’t think Rigoletta Monteverdi will

12
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,129
be a good president
The only news is “Rigoletta Monterverdi

13
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,950
has been elected president”.

14
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,950
Sarah and Michaela are expressing two different
opinions here.

15
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,079
Remember:
News are facts.

16
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,900
Facts are the same for everybody.

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,740
Opinions are not facts.

18
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,200
Opinions are not the same for everybody.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,079
You will find both news and opinions in the
media.

20
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,899
Check these useful expressions.

21
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:37,050
When people express opinions they use verbs
such as believe, like or think:

22
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,149
I think the new educational law is very good.

23
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:42,860
I believe the new educational law is very
good.

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,700
I like the new educational law, it is very
good.

25
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,500
Some of those verbs can be used in the negative
form to express an opinion:

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,180
I don’t think the new educational law is
very good.

27
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,259
I don’t like the new educational law, it’s
not very good.

28
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:03,750
I don’t believe the new educational law
is very good.

29
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,000
People can also express that they don’t
like something.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,300
Use hate or dislike.

31
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,980
I hate the new educational law.

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,330
I dislike the new educational law.

33
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,450
Another way to express opinions is by using
expressions such as as I see it, from my point

34
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,670
of view or in my opinion:
In my opinion, the new educational law is

35
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,340
very good.

36
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,140
As I see it, the new educational law is very
good.

37
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,620
You are also expressing an opinion when you
say you share or don’t share somebody’s

38
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,480
point of view.

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,680
Use the verbs agree or disagree:
I agree with the President when she says that

40
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,450
it’s a good time to do that.

41
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,150
I disagree with the President when she says
that it’s a good time to do that.

42
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,230
Opinions can be made stronger by using adverbs
such as definitely, firmly, truly, strongly

43
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,380
or really.

44
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,879
I firmly believe that the future will be better
than the past.

45
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,260
They really dislike what the president said.

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,129
I strongly disagree with you.

47
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:10,569
When an opinion is given, it’s always a
good idea to explain it.

48
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:12,130
Use because and since.

49
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,840
I strongly disagree with banning mobile phones
at school because they are a great

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
learning tool.

51
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,150
I think it’s a good idea to ban mobiles
at school since they are very distracting.

52
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,959
People have different roles in the media.

53
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,060
Usually, hosts and reporters tell the news.

54
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:36,790
Panellists give their opinions
Now you know how to express your opinion.

55
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,840
